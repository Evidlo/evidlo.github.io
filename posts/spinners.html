    <p>I came up with these little spinning doodads a few years ago around Christmas and I haven't seen anything like them online, so I'm writing about them here as they are quite fun to make.  I've just been calling these things "can spinners" (ChatGPT suggested "twirluminum").</p>
<p>They are cut from aluminum soda cans and spin on sharpened tips of wire from the heat rising off the lamp.</p>
<p>I got my family to create their own this year and it was interesting to see the variety of designs they came up with.</p>

<p>All the spinners shown above are made from sides and bottoms of recycled soda cans.</p>
<p>My process usually goes like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cut out blanks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create the central dimple</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I usually just use a hard, blunt object like a ballpoint pen to push a dimple into the aluminum without crushing it.  Can bottoms are made from thicker aluminum, so I had to gently tap on the back of the pen with a hammer to make the dimple.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cut out blades and bend into shape.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trim material as necessary for balance.</p>
</li>
</ol>
